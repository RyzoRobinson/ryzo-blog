This has been a long time coming, got a little overwhelemed with social media and decided that a blog would be a better way to post slightly higher quality content compared to the mental vomit i spew on twitter. 

Here it goes. 

The fact it has taken me so long to set up a simple website despite having a computing degree is explanation enough of how often I'll be updating.

Stay tuned!......or don't, you do you.
